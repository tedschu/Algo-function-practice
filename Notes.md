# Overall learnings:

- Hash maps (Map) is good for lookups when you need a key/value pair, for ex: to find the number of instances of a given element in an array
  - Common methods: map.has (finds whether a key exists in the map), map.set (adds a key/value pair to the map), map.get (for a given key, returns the value)
- Sets (Set) is good for finding unique elements. It is akin to an array that will remove duplicates that are added. Useful for finding unique values in a string or array (see pangrams)
